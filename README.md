# ForetFusion
Code to compute coadds for Lya-forest data in BOSS and eBOSS, new gen.

This is a refactoring of the code of the same name, initially put together by Jose Vazquez and Anze Slosar
(here github.com/slosar/ForetFusion and github.com/ja-vazquez/ForetFusion). Due to weight of the previously created repo, this is a freshly created repo.


## Installation

The package comprises of the ffusion module and a driver in `exec/ff_driver.py`

First install the module by running

```
./setup.py install
```

or to leaving things within your own area on e.g. NERSC:

```
./setup.py install --user
```

Then the driver should be run like this, specifying config file

```
./exec/ff_driver.py config/nersc.ini
```

Multiprocessing is supporter either by MPI or by multiprocessing module. See config file.
Config file format should be fairly self-explanatory.
